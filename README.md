  solve the 154 problems posted before 2014-10-20 on the website oj.leetcode.com.

##Note:

  for each problem, I have created a folder to write the solution , test code and Readme(for algorithm explanation).

this is the first time to complete those problems , so the solution may be not very simple or effective, and I will continue to do the optimization of it.

Any problems, please contact to me by the email(ustc.sosohu@gmail.com).
