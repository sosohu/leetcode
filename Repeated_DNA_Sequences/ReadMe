Q	All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

	Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

	For example,

	Given s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT",

	Return:
	["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"].

A	Hash, we should code the A, C, G ,T. the A,C,G,T asc-ii code is 0x41, 0x43, 0x47 and 0x54.
	so, the third and second in the last bit is 00, 01, 11 and 10, we can code them.
