Q	Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate element must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

	Note:
	You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
	You must use only constant extra space.
	Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
