	Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

	For example, this binary tree is symmetric:

	    1
	   / \
	  2   2
	 / \ / \
	3  4 4  3
	But the following is not:
	    1
	   / \
	  2   2
	   \   \
	   3    3
	Note:
	Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.

A	for iteration, use two vector to save the left part and right part level by level
