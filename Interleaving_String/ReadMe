Q	Given s1, s2, s3, find whether s3 is formed by the interleaving of s1 and s2.

	For example,
	Given:
	s1 = "aabcc",
	s2 = "dbbca",

	When s3 = "aadbbcbcac", return true.
	When s3 = "aadbbbaccc", return false.

A	DP can solve the problem
	set data[i][j] record wheather s1[i] amd s2[j] can construct the s3[i+j]

	if you use the recursitive way, there will be limited tp the time.
	so , the faster way is using 2-dim array to construct from short th long
