Q	Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.


	Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].


	The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

	For example,
	Given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3],
	return 10.

A	S[n] is the largest area of h[1], ... , h[n]
	left[k] is the longest continuous left direction with value greater than h[k]
	right[k] is the longest continuous right direction with value greater than h[k]

	for example: 2,3,4,3,1,1
	the left :   0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 6
	the right:   3, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0

	S[n] = max{ h[i] * (left[i] + right[i] + 1) }  i = 1, 2, 3, ... , n
