Q	Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

	For example,
	S = "ADOBECODEBANC"
	T = "ABC"
	Minimum window is "BANC".

	Note:
	If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the emtpy string "".

	If there are multiple such windows, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.

A	very difficult
	there are two pointers, I want to say:

	(1) how to search a characters is or is not in the T ?
			we can make a array with length is 256, expect[256];
		eg: T = "ABC"  ---->   expect['A'] = 1, expect['B'] = 1, expect['C'] = 1, other = 0;
		so, we can easyly check the characters in S wheather in T

	(2) how to change the seq we have found?
			we have found a seg that all characters have been found in the seq.
		then after the seq, the first characters in the T, if the characters is same
		to the first one of the seq, we can delete the first one of seq and add this one
		to the seq, and re-compute the length of seq
