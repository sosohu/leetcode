Q	Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

	Note:
	Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

A	general way: for each bit, sum the value and mod 2, the outcome is the only one's value
	special way: for each bit, xor them
