	Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

	The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

	For example,
	Given board =

	[
	  ["ABCE"],
	  ["SFCS"],
	  ["ADEE"]
	]
	word = "ABCCED", -> returns true,
	word = "SEE", -> returns true,
	word = "ABCB", -> returns false.	

A	general BFS, however, you should deal it very carefully, such as you can
	pass the vector by & , or you will meet LTE
