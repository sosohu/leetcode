Q	Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.
	Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.
	For example, given s = "aab",
	Return 1 since the palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.

A	set min[n] is the min cut of s[1] ... s[n]
	set P[i][j] is true when s[i] ... s[j] is partitioning

	min[n] = min{ min[j] + 1 };     if j < n && P[j+1][n] ,   it is a DP problem

	so, how the compute the P[i][j]; 
	P[i][j] = s[i] == s[j] && P[i+1][j-1];     it is a DP problem 

	O(n^2) time complex
