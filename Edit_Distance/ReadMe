Q	Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)
	
	You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:
	
	a) Insert a character
	b) Delete a character
	c) Replace a character

A	word1(n) : word2(m) ----> S[n, m]
	if(word2[n] == word2[m])
		S[n, m] = S[n-1, m-1]
	else
		S[n, m] = min{S[n-1][m-1] + 1, S[n-1][m] + 1, S[n][m-1]+1}
