Q	Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

	For example, 
	Given [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1], return 6.


	The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Thanks Marcos for contributing this image!

A	left[i] means on the left side of A[i], the largest one which bigger than A[i], if none, value is set 0.
	right[i] means on the right side of A[i], the largest one which bigger than A[i], if none, value is set 0

	so, the trap of A[i] is the min{left[i], right[i]}
