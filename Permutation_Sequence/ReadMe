Q	The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

	By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
	We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):

	"123"
	"132"
	"213"
	"231"
	"312"
	"321"
	Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

	Note: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.

A	from the first one to the last one
	for fisrt one: k / (n-1)! -> index, so use the index to get the number, and mark the number used
	continue this action until to the last one.
