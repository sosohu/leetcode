Q	Follow up for "Search in Rotated Sorted Array":
	What if duplicates are allowed?

	Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

	Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.

A	for A[low] , ... ,A[high]	
	mid = (low + high)/2;
	if(mid == low) we can set low = mid , and try again
	if(high == low) we can set high = mid , and try again

	default: use the first problem's way.
